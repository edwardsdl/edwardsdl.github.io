        <h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>You've found my GitHub user page. Unless you're interested in one of <a href="https://github.com/edwardsdl">my projects on GitHub</a>, there isn't much to see. If that's why you're here, keep reading!</p>

<h3>I want to use your stuff!</h3>

<p>Awesome, thank you! :)</p>

<p>I publish the libraries for almost all of my projects on the <a href="http://nuget.org/">public NuGet gallery</a>. You can view all of my packages <a href="https://nuget.org/profiles/edwardsdl/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Where possible I provide my source code under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>. In a nutshell, feel free to use the source in both personal and commercial products as long as you keep the copyright header intact. Obviously I'd prefer if you publish your code under an open source license, but ultimately it's up to you.</p>

<h3>How can I contribute to a repository?</h3>

<p>I really appreciate your help!</p>

<p>I track all of my issues through GitHub, so it's easy to jump on a broken or underdeveloped feature. If you have any questions, feel free to post them on the issue page.</p>

<p>I use StyleCop and ReSharper to maintain a consistent code style. If you don't have access to these programs, make an effort to emulate the coding style found throughout the rest of the code base. If you do have them installed, the appropriate settings should be picked up automatically. I keep the configuration files - Settings.StyleCop, and <em>Solution Name</em>.sln.DotSettings - in the root of the source directory. Please <strong>do not</strong> modify these files.</p>

<h3>How do I contact you?</h3>

<p>Well that depends on why you want to talk to me! If you've got a comment or question about one of my repositories, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:github@dallasedwards.com">github@dallasedwards.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you're an employer or recruiter, contact me at <a href="mailto:jobs@dallasedwards.com">jobs@dallasedwards.com</a>.</p>
