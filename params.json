{"name":"Dallas @ GitHub","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome\r\nYou've found my GitHub user page. Unless you're interested in one of [my projects on GitHub](https://github.com/edwardsdl), there isn't much to see here. If that's why you're here, keep reading!\r\n\r\n### I want to use your stuff!\r\nAwesome, thank you! :)\r\n\r\nI publish the libraries for almost all of my projects on the [public NuGet gallery](http://nuget.org/). You can view all of my packages [here](https://nuget.org/profiles/edwardsdl/).\r\n\r\nWhere possible I provide my source code under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). In a nutshell, feel free to use the source in commercial products as long as you include a copy of the license. Obviously I'd prefer if you publish your code under an open source license, but ultimately it's up to you.\r\n\r\n### How can I contribute to a repository?\r\nI really appreciate your help!\r\n\r\nI track all of my issues through GitHub, so it's easy to jump on a broken or underdeveloped feature. If you have any questions, feel free to post them on the issue page.\r\n\r\nI use StyleCop and ReSharper to maintain a consistent code style. If you don't have access to these programs, make an effort to emulate the coding style found throughout the rest of the code base. If you do have them installed, the appropriate settings should be picked up automatically. I keep the configuration files - Settings.StyleCop, and *.sln.DotSettings - in the root of the source directory. Please **do not** modify these files.\r\n\r\n### How do I contact you?\r\nWell that depends on why you want to talk to me! If you've got a comment or question about one of my repositories, you can reach me at github@dallasedwards.com.\r\n\r\nIf you're an employer or recruiter, contact me at jobs@dallasedwards.com.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
